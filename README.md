Convert words/sentences/phrases into a color coded flag

## What this does
- It takes a string that you have entered and converts it into a list of hexadecimal values
- It coverts the hexcode into colours and uses these colours to make a flag with stripes of different colours
- This can be used to encode text or phrases or anything ascii into an image
